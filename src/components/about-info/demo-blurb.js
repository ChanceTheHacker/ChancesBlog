const demo = `You know those construction workers in cartoons? as it turns out,
art imitates life. Those loud, coarse people, they exist. I know
because that's me. The rest of those guys, they work for me. We cuss
too much, we're always yelling, and we make fun of each other when
feelings get hurt. And somehow I'm supposed to tell these obnoxious
type A personalities what they need to do. Well, they'd never admit
it but, they have feelings too. If you treat them well the job goes
great. But when you're wrong, every time you turn around they will
drop their tools and grab their phone. That's a good way to get
yourself chewed out by the big boss. I've spent over a decade
studying what works and what doesn't, so let's talk about it.`

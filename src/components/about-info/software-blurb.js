const software = `I'm just a web developing fool. I got into coding as a teen playing
  warcraft 3. There was a really insane editor in the game that had
  it's own scripting language called JASS. I was really into making
  custom games at the time, so I eventually taught myself to use it.
  As they say, after you learn your first language, to learn a new one
  all you need to learn is syntax. Ever since then I've dabbled in
  coding here and there until A few years ago I learned that if I
  actually took this seriously, I could make my own career out of it.
  I never imagined I could get a job without a CS degree, so coding
  was always just a hobby, but in the past few years I've become quite
  serious about my coding and carrer change.`
